Hello there. 

Since we all saw what happened over XDA (wew, that was huge with that #freedil3mm4 stuff), 
I've put up this support infrastructure to Descendant. 

Mainly I've added two powerful tools:

1. Bug Report tool

This is nothing more than a [repository](https://github.com/Descendant/bug_tracker) to keep track of the bugs and display them in the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/Descendant/projects/1) of Descendant.
You're advised to use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/Descendant/bug_tracker/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

2. This Github page

Well, enough said, you can found the downloads, this blogs, changelogs and even more. 

Thanks for your support, 

Dil3mm4
