## About

Descendant it's an Android Custom ROM that aims to add useful tweaks over Google's Android AOSP 9.
Nothing fancy, straight AOSP plus some tweaks that per-my-idea should be shipped by default in any pure AOSP.

Founded and leaded by {% include icon-github.html username="Dil3mm4" %}, Descendant it's an open-source project that (at the moment) targets Treble enabled devices.

I'm open to any contribution. 

You can head to the sources at {% include icon-github.html username="Descendant" %} 

Also, do mind that this project requires a lot of efforts, sleepless nights and strenuous perseverance.

You may have noticed that I'm not monetizing the downloads with ADS services. 

If you're appreciating my ROM, please consider to donate via Paypal at dil3mm4.dev@gmail.com
